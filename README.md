## Abstract

_Online social media enables immediate reporting of disaster events. Automated and scalable detection of disaster information in social media is critical for fast and efficient disaster response. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) have the potential to improve disaster event detection in online media. A central challenge is to develop ML based disaster detection that is fair, such that detection works well for all groups in an affected population. While disaster reporting in online social media within a regional context is subject of research, globally operating disaster response systems are unexplored in terms of fairness. Hence, I investigate fairness of disaster event classification on a transnational level (with respect to countries). Inequalities in this regard are investigated at the global level rather than at the regional or individual level. Since socio-economic data at the transnational level is difficult to retrieve, I develop a method for grouping countries based on development indexes. Development indexes are well-established indicators for studying inequalities across countries, and here I propose them as sensitive variables in the context of disaster response. This novel approach enables examining fairness on global level beyond plain geo-diversity. Evaluating a disaster detection algorithm trained on the MEDIC dataset for groups of countries based on a set of development indexes, my results show for a variety of disaster classification tasks (disaster types, humanitarian, informative and damage severity) that automated disaster event detection in online social media content performs better for some country groups. For subcategories of these tasks, I find differences in classification metrics of up to 51% points. Diverging classification metrics are correlated with the number of samples available for each country group. Notably, I did not find a systematic bias of the ML model for a particular country group. Groupings by development indexes rather articulate the different expressions of disasters regarding their representation in social media by different country groups. I discuss implications of my findings and highlight limitations as well as potential extensions._
